## How to Run

```
python trainer.py

## Description

You need to have your token and the classifier id of ynlu module.

If the prediction result doesn't not conform to your expectation, the test text will be added to the matched INTENT as an utterance.

(Note: By entering "2" (the result is not correct ), the utterance must be added to the classifier. Always type "1" if you don't want to train the model.)

To stop training and testing, simply type `train_stop` to exit.
